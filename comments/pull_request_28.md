Hey @coding-agent, could you significantly enhance the liquid glass effects with the following improvements:

ðŸŒŠ **More transparency** - increase backdrop-filter blur to 40px minimum and reduce background opacity to 0.6-0.7

ðŸ’Ž **Stronger glassmorphism** - add iridescent borders with rainbow animations and multi-layer gradient overlays

âœ¨ **Liquid animations** - add morphing background shapes, ripple effects on interactions, and smooth liquid spreading on hover states

ðŸŽ¨ **Premium effects** - add subtle particle systems, glass distortion effects, and continuous gradient flows

This would help match the reference images provided for that true liquid glass aesthetic! Thanks!
