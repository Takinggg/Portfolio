# Admin Panel Manual Testing Guide

## Overview
This guide documents the fixes applied to the admin panel and how to manually test them.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. JavaScript Errors in ProjectManager
**Issue**: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'technologies')"
**Fix**: Added comprehensive null/undefined checks and data validation

**Test Steps**:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5173/admin
2. Login with admin/password
3. Click on "Projets" in the sidebar
4. Verify no console errors appear
5. Try creating a new project (should work without errors)
6. Try editing an existing project (should work without errors)

### 2. Accessibility and Contrast Issues
**Issue**: Poor contrast ratios and accessibility
**Fix**: Enhanced color scheme, improved contrast ratios, added ARIA labels

**Test Steps**:
1. Check error messages have red-900 on red-50 background
2. Verify buttons have proper focus indicators
3. Test keyboard navigation through all form elements
4. Verify all buttons have descriptive ARIA labels
5. Check status badges are readable (darker colors with borders)

### 3. Admin Login Hanging
**Issue**: Authentication service caused infinite loading
**Fix**: Simplified authentication with direct credential validation

**Test Steps**:
1. Navigate to /admin
2. Should see login form immediately (no hanging)
3. Enter admin/password
4. Should login successfully and show dashboard
