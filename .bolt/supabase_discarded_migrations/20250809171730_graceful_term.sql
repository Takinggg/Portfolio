/*
  # Fix Row Level Security Policies for Admin Panel

  1. Security Changes
    - Update RLS policies to allow public access for admin operations
    - Enable INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations for authenticated and public users
    - Maintain SELECT access for public users

  2. Tables Updated
    - `blog_posts`: Allow full CRUD operations
    - `projects`: Allow full CRUD operations

  Note: In a production environment, you should implement proper authentication
  and restrict these policies to authenticated admin users only.
